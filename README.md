This is a *very* insecure forum. You can host a version of it yourself by cloning the repository and running `docker compose up -d` in the directory where you cloned it to.

## Flaws
* All users and comments will be lost if the server goes down
* Passwords are stored and sent in plaintext
* No way to change a password or recover an account
